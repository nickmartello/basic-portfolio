                    <p>Here we go...My names Nick and I'm trying to figure out how to build a website from scratch so stick with me.  I enjoy long walks on the beach and am a sucker for french poetry.  Usually when I write a bio about myself it's on Tinder or some other dating app that I'm sure whoever is reading this would not be interested in, also its NSFW.  So some nonsense I can write down to fill up the page without boring you with Lorem Ipsum is what I'm gonna resorting to. I enjoy icey cold water and sleeping with a fan on. Thank you for sticking around and making it to this point, you're the real MVP!</p>
